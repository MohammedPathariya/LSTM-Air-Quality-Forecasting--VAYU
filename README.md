# üß† VAYU - Air Quality Prediction using LSTM and Stacked LSTM

Air pollution is a pressing environmental challenge, especially in urban areas where millions of people are exposed to hazardous air quality. This project leverages machine learning techniques, particularly **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **Stacked LSTM**, to **predict the Air Quality Index (AQI)** using real-time sensor data from the [OpenAQ API](https://openaq.org/).

## üåç Problem Statement

Air pollution causes significant health risks such as asthma, lung disease, and cancer. Accurate AQI prediction can help authorities and individuals take preventive measures in time.

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives

- Collect real-time air quality data from OpenAQ API
- Clean and preprocess the data (PM1, PM2.5, PM10, UM010, UM025, UM100)
- Visualize pollution trends and parameter correlations
- Calculate AQI based on Indian and WHO guidelines
- Train predictive models using:
  - Simple LSTM
  - 3-layer Stacked LSTM
  - 4-layer Stacked LSTM
- Compare RMSE performance metrics
- Generate actionable insights for public health

## üìå Workflow Overview

1. **Fetch & Store Data**:
   - Pull measurements from OpenAQ API
   - Store raw data to CSV

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Drop unnecessary columns
   - Parse timestamp into date & time
   - Pivot data for time-series modeling
   - Normalize values for association mining

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot PM and UM concentration trends
   - Display WHO vs India AQI standards
   - Map sensor locations using Folium
   - Correlation matrix heatmaps

4. **AQI Calculation**:
   - Based on Indian AQI standards (PM2.5 & PM10)
   - Custom function to assign AQI category

5. **Association Rule Mining**:
   - Apriori algorithm with min support 0.1 and confidence 0.7
   - Identify co-occurrence of pollutant levels

6. **Modeling**:
   - Split data into train/test
   - Apply MinMax scaling
   - Train three models:
     - Simple LSTM
     - 3-layer Stacked LSTM
     - 4-layer Stacked LSTM
   - Evaluate with RMSE

## üß™ Model Results

| Model Type           | Train RMSE | Test RMSE |
|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| Simple LSTM          | 32.38      | 29.93     |
| 3-layer Stacked LSTM | 8.03       | 3.16      |
| 4-layer Stacked LSTM | 7.48       | 3.13      |

‚úÖ **Stacked LSTM outperforms Simple LSTM** by capturing temporal dependencies more effectively.
